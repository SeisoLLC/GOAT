# GOAT Development Notes

## Environment Setup

Ensure you have `docker` and `pipenv` installed locally, and the `docker` daemon is running. Then run the following command to install the dependencies onto
your local system:

```bash
task init
```

We are also in the process of migrating from `Invoke` to `Taskfile`; if you want to use the `task` commands, you must install `Taskfile`

### Helpful tasks

Build all of the supported docker images:

```bash
PLATFORM='all' task build
```

To build a docker image for a specific platform, set `PLATFORM` to either `linux/arm64` or `linux/amd64`.

## Running the goat against the goat project locally

There are two ways of running the `goat` locally:

1. To see how it will look in a pipeline:

    ```bash
    task test
    ```

    Or run `task test -- debug` to run it in debug mode.

2. For speed during development, `docker` caching can be helpful:

    ```bash
    docker build .
    docker run -v $PWD:/goat/ --rm <first several character of the hash output from the build step>
    ```

3. It is possible to pass custom arguments or config file paths to the linters in the goat using environment variables (detailed in `linters.json`).
   Examples:

   `docker run -e RUFF_CONFIG='check --config <path to new config> -v' --rm <hash>`

    ```bash
    docker run -e INPUT_EXCLUDE='.*\.json$' -e BLACK_CONFIG='--required-version 21.9b0' -v $PWD:/goat/ --rm <hash>

    Note: Linter env variables must be formatted as <LINTER_CONFIG>, i.e. RUFF_CONFIG, CFN_LINT_CONFIG, etc.,
    and the values supplied will take precedence over the default autofix or standard arguments supplied in the goat.
    Any desired autofix arguments must be explicitly supplied as part of the new env variable value.

4. Autofix is available for certain linters and is enabled by default. To disable autofix, use one of these approaches:
   1. `docker run -e INPUT_AUTO_FIX="false" -v "$PWD:/goat/" --rm <hash>` or
   2. `INPUT_AUTO_FIX=false task test`

### Linter Update Considerations

1. If adding linters to `linters.json`, the `executor` is an optional member of the linter object.
2. The `autofix` member is also optional. If a linter has an autofix command-line option, this field holds those arguments.

### Iterating on Taskfile.yml files

Make sure you update the submodule to point to your working branch, otherwise your changes under `Task/` will not affect the parent `Taskfile.yml` tasks that
`include` the `goat/Task/**/Taskfile.yml` files. We can't avoid this because the `Task/**/Taskfile.yml` files have a relative `dir:` and if the `goat` uses it
directly (avoiding a submodule) then the relative dir is one folder level different than every project that uses it. Consider a helper alias like this for use
when developing:

```bash
alias updategoat='git add -A && git commit -m "Update goat" && ggp && cd goat && ggpull && cd .. && git add -A && git commit -m "Update submodule" && ggp
```

This should automatically get reset after your code is merge into `main`.

## Common Errors

When attempting a `PLATFORM=all task build` you may encounter this error:

```bash
ERROR: Multiple platforms feature is currently not supported for docker driver. Please switch to a different driver (eg. "docker buildx create --use")

task: Failed to run task "build": exit status 1
```

Recreating your `desktop-linux` builder instance may fix it:

```bash
docker context rm -f desktop-linux
docker buildx create --name desktop-linux --driver docker-container --use
```
